*******Liver Disease Prediction*********
Overview

This project aims to predict the likelihood of liver disease in patients using machine learning techniques. By analyzing patient health data, the system provides insights that could help in early detection and intervention.

****Technologies Used*******

Programming Language: Python
Machine Learning Algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression
Data Processing & Visualization: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Model Evaluation: Scikit-learn

******Features********

Data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values and outliers.
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand patterns in the dataset.

Implementation of multiple machine learning models to predict liver disease likelihood.

Model evaluation and fine-tuning to optimize prediction accuracy.

******Usage*******

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/liver-disease-prediction.git

2. Install the required packages:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the main script to train and test the models:
   python main.py

4.Input patient data to get predictions for liver disease likelihood.

******Results******

1. SVM and Logistic Regression models achieved strong performance after fine-tuning.
2. Basic visualizations highlight the relationships between features and the target variable.

********Future Work*******

1. Integrate additional algorithms to improve accuracy.
2. Deploy as a web application for interactive predictions.
3. Incorporate feature selection and dimensionality reduction techniques
